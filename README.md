# Antrea Operator For Kubernetes

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0)

## Overview

The Antrea Operator installs [Antrea](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/antrea/)
CNI plugin on a Kubernetes cluster.
The operator will be deployed as deployment and it will take care of deploying
Antrea components:

* The antrea-controller deployment
* The antrea-agent daemonset

At the moment the antrea operator only works on OpenShift 4 platform, the
support for other platforms is still in progress.

The antrea operator uses a dedicated CRD(`AntreaInstall`) object for
antrea-controller and antrea-agent configuration. Users can set antrea
configurations using the CRD instance. The operator monitors the update of
AntreaInstall CR and restarts the relevant pods so that the relevant
configuration changes are picked up.

## Build

Building the antrea operator docker image is very simple. From the project root
directory simply type the following command.

```
make all
```

To build antrea operator binary. Run the following command.

```
make bin
```

## Try it out on OpenShift 4 cluster

For Openshift 4 clusters, antrea operator will be deployed in the early phases
of cluster deployment. The antrea operator monitors cluster network
configuration CRD(`Network.config.openshift.io/v1`) object to update the
container network CIDRs and service network CIDRs used by Antrea.

Generate install-config.yaml by using openshift-install command.
```
$ openshift-install --dir=MY_CLUSTER create install-config
```

Edit `MY_CLUSTER/install-config.yaml` to update networking section.
Change `networkType` to `antrea`(case insensitive).
Set container network CIDRs `clusterNetwork` and `serviceNetwork` in
`MY_CLUSTER/install-config.yaml`.

Create manifest files:
```
$ openshift-install --dir=MY_CLUSTER create manifests
```
Put operator yaml files from `deploy/` to
`MY_CLUSTER/manifests`. Edit `operator.antrea.vmware.com_v1_antreainstall_cr.yaml`
to set Antrea configurations and image version.

Generate ignition configuration files:
```
$ openshift-install --dir=MY_CLUSTER create ignition-configs
```
This bootstrap ignition file will be added to the terraform tfvars.
Then use terraform to install Openshift 4 cluster on vSphere.

### Cluster network config
Cluster network config is initially set in install-config.yaml, user could apply
`Network.config.openshift.io` CRD to update `clusterNetwork` and
`serviceNetwork` in `manifests/cluster-network-02-config.yml`.

*Example configurations*
```
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: Network
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  networkType: antrea
  clusterNetwork:
  - cidr: 10.10.0.0/14
  serviceNetwork:
  - 172.30.0.0/16
```

### Operator CR
Operator CR `antrea-install` is used to provide antrea configurations:
- AntreaAgentConfig holds the configurations for antrea-agent.
- AntreaCNIConfig holds the configurations of CNI.
- AntreaControllerConfig holds the configurations for antrea-controller.
- AntreaImage is the Antrea image name and version used by antrea-agent and antrea-controller.
